# Decompilation_Tool

Definition: Decompilation is translating compiled bytecode(.pyc files)/executables back to readable source code. Critical when source code is unavailable but analysis, updates, or audits are needed.

The project uses uncompyle6, a python bytecode decompiler, to build a decompilation tool that accepts a bytecode file(.pyc file), and returns a .py file. Tkinter was used to design the GUI application.

The project is a part of Hackveda Solutions Internship.
